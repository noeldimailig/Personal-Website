					<h3>Drive</h3>
					<p>As a young boy, I often envy those kids at my age who can ride bicycle that time, but today I don't care anymore simply because I can drive more than just a bicycle. Now, I can drive a bicycle, motorcycle, tricycle, cars either manual or automatic, and as well as trucks. As a matter of fact, I have got my non-professional driver's license when I was 17 with a restriction of 1 and 2. I am planning to upgrade it to a professional one someday and if possible I want to add another code restriction to my license.</p>

					<h3>Edit</h3>
					<p>As I've mention in the about section I'm a BSIT student so having the knowledge to do minor or major editing is a plus in this kind of course. I am not proficient enough when it comes to editing especially photos and videos but I always find myself finished something that looks good to me. Some of the softwares that I use or have used are the following; Photoshop for photo manipulation, Microsoft Word for word editing, Microsoft Powerpoint for presentation and lastly Power Director for video editing.</p>

					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>Being a BSIT student opens up a different world for me, now that I have the knowledge on how things work in the fields of information and technology I want to be part of it. I want to build something that might be useful not just for me but for the community as well. Currently, the technology that I can use or have basic understanding are HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript and PHP for front and back web development. Then there is C# for desktop applications and game development. Then when it comes to database I often used MySql database for data manipulation.</p>

					<h3>Watch</h3>
					<p>My favorite way to get out of stress over something is to watch anime of different genres. Some of my favorite anime to watch are One Piece, Black Clover, Hunter X Hunter, Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen. I laso watch youtube tutorials about something and also Hollywood movies but most of the time I watch anime.</p>

					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>When there is time I practice a lot of coding particularly web development and as part of my learning process I also watch coding tutorials from youtuber's like Traversy Media, Web Dev Simplified, Kevin Powel, Dev Ed and so many more to mention. I combine what I learn to them and to the teachings from school. As of now my coding skill is not that good but I will do my best to be a good programmer someday.</p>

					<h3>Read</h3>
					<p>One of my other past time is to read. I read a lot especially manga and web toon when the anime version is delayed or something. Other things that I read other than manga and webtoon are mostly related to my course for better understanding of the topic and self improvement.</p>

					<h3>Listen</h3>
					<p>Listening to music is best especially when the music are chilling. You will feel very comfortable and at ease when there is music present at your surrounding. My favorite music to isten to are those made of our very own bands and singers like for example Parokya Ni Edgar, Ben and Ben, Itchyworms and etc.Then there is Still One for rap music that you can relate yourself to.</p>

					<p>Of course there's the eating hobby, who doesn't want to eat and eat and eat. However as much as I love to eat when the food is something that I am not familiar with or related to exotic food I guess I'll have to say pass for the time being. Most of the food that I enjoyed the most are those with meats.</p>

			<div class="career">
				<div class="desc">
					<h3>Programmer | Web Developer</h3>
					<p>Given the fact that our world right now is being run by  Information Technology and as myself a BSIT student would love to make a career in it. My top 3 career path to go to someday is first Web Developing because its very simple yet powerful. Next is being a game developer to make something especial because I myself is an avid fan of video games. And lastly, being a cybersecurity expert to take down those bad guys using their knowledge for the betterment of their self interest.</p>

			<div class="stocks">
				<div class="desc">
					<h3>Stock Market</h3>
					<p>Another plan of mine is that to make a career in doing trading in the stock market because everything in this world is driven by money why not follow the trail of the powerful and the successful. Owning stock locally and internationally is a big advantage for you in the long run compare to those individuals that just let their money sit in the bank for just a small percentage in return.</p>

			<div class="currency">

					<h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
					<p>If our world continues to be driven by technology in the future I think it's better for us to hodl some of the famous cryptocurrency nowadays like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. I envy those people that able to buy bitcoin way back during the price drop of it last March due to pandemic, now they are one of the many who is a millionaire or even a billionaire in just a small period of time. As of the time I writing this the current price of bitcoin is Php 2,443,854.39 and the all time high is Php 3 million plus.</p>
